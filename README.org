* SXML<->XML
  
  This is an attempt to make a bridge between XML and SXML, that is,
  editing SXML (XML in s-expression) rather than XML.
  
* How to use it?
  
  1. Put this in your ~.emacs~.
     #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
       (require 'sxml<->xml)
     #+END_SRC
     
  2. Open ~test.xml~.
  
  3. Switch to SXML with C-c '

  4. Switch back to XML with C-c '
  
* TODO What's next?

  - better font locking
  - better integration with nxml-mode
  - ???
  - profit
